description         libevhtp is a replacement API for Libevent s current HTTP API

long_description    Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent s current HTTP API. \
                    The reality of libevent s http interface is that it was created as a JIT server, \
                    meaning the developer never thought of it being used for creating a full-fledged \
                    HTTP service. Infact I am under the impression that the libevent http API was \
                    designed almost as an example of what you can do with libevent. It's not Apache \
                    in a box, but more and more developers are attempting to use it as so.
