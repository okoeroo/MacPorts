description         Shamir's Secret Sharing Service

long_description    Shamir's Secret Sharing is an algorithm in cryptography. It is a form of secret sharing, where a \
                    secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part, where some of the parts \
                    or all of them are needed in order to reconstruct the secret. \
                    Counting on all participants to combine together the secret might be impractical, and therefore \
                    sometimes the threshold scheme is used where any k of the parts are sufficient to reconstruct the \
                    original secret.
